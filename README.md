# react-native-awesome-naver-maps
Naver map package for React Native.

## âš  Notice
This package is currently being developed with Android as a priority.
It's still very early in development, so it's not desirable for commercial services.
It's still very difficult to find a usable map package on Cross Platform such as React Native.
I'm thinking of developing this package hard.
If we could make code together and help, we would be able to create a more desirable direction for development in this ecosystem.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-awesome-naver-maps
```

## Usage

```js
import NaverMap from "react-native-awesome-naver-maps";

// ...

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NaverMap style={{ flex: 1 }}/>
  );
}
```
